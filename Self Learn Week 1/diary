dec 8, need to figure out how to use jupyter notebook, currently in compsci class, going to use this class time to figure it out.

alright its the end of the period, I got juptyer notebook installed with pip, i came across a problem and solved it by using pip3 install -U pip setuptools
and then pip install notebook installed it.

video i watched to set it up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk

jupyter notebook reaction: It seems very organized, it allows plotting and is basically a debugger. Markup is pretty neat, it reminds me of obsidian.md's setup
another neat touch is the ability to run bash commands, very interesting.

I realized my experience from picoctf and playing around with command lines start to show because of the ability to run bash commands with % magic.
